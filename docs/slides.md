# Disclaimer

I wanted to create a project that would solve a real pain point that I
experienced everyday, at work, online and in private:

We lost our ability to differentiating between reality and alternative facts,
to acknowledging our limitation, and to being convinced to change opinion.

This leads us to following unhealthy behaviors, to being more fragile
(physically and mentally) and to being less efficient.

# Punch Line

    The information that we hold for true and our believes
    define our behavior and our life.

It defines how we care about our health, how resilient we are in front of
adversity and how we work with another. The fundamental question is then


    How do we know if our knowledge is a faithful represenation of reality?
